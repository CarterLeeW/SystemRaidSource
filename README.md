# SystemRaidSource

<p>This is the source code to my Unreal Engine 5 Game Demo "System Raid," which is available for download on Itch.io <a href="https://carterleew.itch.io/system-raid" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	My purpose for this project was to create a five minute game demo that demonstrates my proficiency in several key Unreal Engine 5 features. 
</p>
<p>
	This demo began life as a clone of the classroom project "Toon Tanks" from the GameDev.tv online course "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games," which explains some of the class and module names. However, most of the code is original, and the game is now very different from its inspiration.
